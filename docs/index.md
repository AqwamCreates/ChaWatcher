# Welcome To ChaWatcher's Documentation!

ChaWatcher is an anti-cheat that uses machine-learning to detect outlier behaviours. It uses One-Class Support Vector Machine from Aqwam's [DataPredict](aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict/) library.
This documentation contains all the example codes that demonstrates data collection, model training and anomaly detection. There will not be API reference here as I thought this library is preddy simple to use.

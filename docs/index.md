# Welcome To ChaWatcher's Documentation!

ChaWatcher is an anti-cheat that uses machine-learning to detect outlier behaviours. It uses One-Class Support Vector Machine from Aqwam's [DataPredict](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict/) library.

This documentation contains all the example codes that demonstrates data collection, model training and anomaly detection. There will not be API reference here as I thought this library is preddy simple to use.

You only need to collect normal (non-hacker) data. You can include outlier (hacker) data, but it may reduce the ChaWatcher's model accuracy.

If there are any issues for this library, donâ€™t be afraid to reach out to me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/) or in this DevForum thread.

## Example codes (with explanations):

### Original Version

* [Data Collection](ExampleCodes/DataCollection.md)

* [Model Training](ExampleCodes/ModelTraining.md)

* [Anomaly Detection](ExampleCodes/AnomalyDetection.md)

## Difference between original and custom versions:

* Custom version has these functions for both DataCollector and AnomalyDetector that can be called outside of their module scripts:

  * setPlayerPreviousDataVector()

  * setPlayerCurrentDataVector()

  * setPlayerHasMissingData()

  * updateFullDataVector()

* Custom version is an empty template.

* That's really it...

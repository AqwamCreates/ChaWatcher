# Welcome To Aqwam's ChaWatcher Library!

![ChaWatcherIcon](https://github.com/AqwamCreates/ChaWatcher/assets/67371914/876e056c-920a-416d-82b1-00ccb345eef0)

ChaWatcher is an anti-cheat / anomaly detector that uses machine-learning to detect outlier behaviours. It uses One-Class Support Vector Machine from my [DataPredict](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict/) library.

This documentation contains all the example codes that demonstrates data collection, model training and anomaly detection. There will be no API reference here as I thought this library is pretty simple to use.

You only need to collect normal (non-hacker) data. You can include outlier (hacker) data, but it may reduce the ChaWatcher's model accuracy.

If there are any issues for this library, donâ€™t be afraid to reach out to me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/) or in this [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/partial-open-source-chawatcher-a-machine-learning-anti-cheat-anomaly-detector-for-roblox-runs-using-datapredict/2643497?u=myoriginsworkshop) thread.

In addition, if you are interested in Roblox tutorials and future projects by me, then you can subscribe to me in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUrwoxv5dufEmbGsxyEUPZw).

You can get the library from GitHub [here](https://github.com/AqwamCreates/ChaWatcher/blob/main/module_scripts/ChaWatcher.rbxm)!

Please report any bugs [here](https://github.com/AqwamCreates/ChaWatcher/issues)!

## Example codes (with explanations):

### Original Version

* [Data Collection](ExampleCodes/DataCollection.md)

* [Model Training](ExampleCodes/ModelTraining.md)

* [Anomaly Detection](ExampleCodes/AnomalyDetection.md)

### Distributed Computing Version

* [Data Collection](ExampleCodes/DataCollection_DistributedComputing.md)

* [Anomaly Detection](ExampleCodes/AnomalyDetection_DistributedComputing.md)

## Difference between original and custom versions:

* Custom version has these functions for both DataCollector and AnomalyDetector that can be called outside of their module scripts:

  * setPlayerPreviousDataVector()

  * setPlayerCurrentDataVector()

  * setPlayerHasMissingData()
 
  * updateDataVectors()

  * updateFullDataVector()

* Custom version is an empty template. Put what you want there!

* That's really it...

## Tips:

* Use "radialBasisFunction" as your first choice of kernel function for training models. If the accuracy is weak, then "sigmoid". Use "linear" and "polynomial" as a last resort! This rule is an exception if you have domain or machine learning knowledge.

* Set the c value to very small if you want majority of your data points be a "normal" data.

* For the original version, the model training can handle up to 500 data when used with "radialBasisFunction" kernel functions.
